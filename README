I implementated the sweepline algorithm for calculate intersections between multiple segments.

The describe of sweepline algorithm can be find in the computational geometry algorithms and applications by M.de Berg

I built a event queue to store the endpoint of segment, and the event queue is implementated with a Red-Black tree.

The state sturctrue which means the segments that intersection wich the sweepline would be store in a Red-Black tree too.

And the program is wrriten by C++ languege.
